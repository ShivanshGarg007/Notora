# 📚 Notora - Simplified Lecture Notes Organizer

## 🧠 Project Idea

**Notora** is a MERN stack-based web application designed to organize and manage lecture notes effectively. It acts as a community-driven platform where users can upload, download, and access high-quality lecture notes for subjects like **Java**, **C++**, and **Web Development**.

The platform offers both **free** and **premium** note sections, making it easier for students to find reliable resources. Additionally, it leverages **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** via an API to extract searchable text from images of handwritten or printed notes. Users can interact through a chat feature, making this a collaborative platform for learners.
